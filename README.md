# One Photo, One Song

## Running the app

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

## Check out a demo
Access the app with a demo song and photo at:

```
http://localhost:8000/?photoUrl=http://distilleryimage5.ak.instagram.com/bec4a3e6532d11e3893112e1b6328fc9_8.jpg&songUrl=http://previews.7digital.com/clips/34/4987867.clip.mp3/
```

## What's next?

Why not help out with the development of this app? There are a ton of features we still need to implement:

* A helper method for parsing query params
* Tests for our existing code
* Styling
* Instagram profile integration (another model)
* Another view for creating a new SoundStripe (the combo of image and song)
* ?
